/**
 * Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.

 Try to solve it in linear time/space.

 Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.

 You may assume all elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.
